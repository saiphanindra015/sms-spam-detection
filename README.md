1. **Objective**: Build a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).
2. **Dataset**: Use the widely-known SMS Spam Collection Dataset containing labeled text messages.
3. **Preprocessing**: Apply text cleaning, tokenization, and convert messages into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.
4. **Modeling**: Train classification algorithms like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression for efficient text categorization.
5. **Evaluation**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess spam detection performance.
